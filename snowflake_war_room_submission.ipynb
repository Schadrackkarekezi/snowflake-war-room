   "source": "## How it works\n\n```\nUser clicks \"Launch Agent\"\n        ↓\nAI Agent (Claude) calls tools to look at the data\n        ↓\nTools query the CSV files and return results\n        ↓\nAgent analyzes what it found and generates output\n```\n\nThe agents use Claude's tool-calling feature - basically the AI can decide to call functions like `check_anomalies()` or `get_analyst_ratings()` to gather info before generating questions."

   "source": "## Main Components\n\n**QuestionAgent** - Runs up to 5 tool calls to research weaknesses, then outputs 5 analyst questions\n\n**DefenseAgent** - Looks for positive metrics and recent wins, drafts a response with bullet points\n\n**TopicQuestionGenerator** - If you type in a topic like \"AI adoption\", it generates targeted questions about that\n\n**MetricsEngine** - Does the math stuff:\n- Compares current quarter to the 4-quarter average (flags if >20% below)\n- Checks if NRR is declining for multiple quarters in a row\n- Calculates growth rates vs competitors\n\n### Tools the agents can use\n\n- `get_snowflake_metrics()` - pulls revenue, NRR, RPO, FCF numbers\n- `check_anomalies()` - returns anything flagged as concerning\n- `get_analyst_ratings()` - what the sell-side thinks\n- `search_transcripts()` - search through earnings calls\n- `compare_to_competitor()` - Snowflake vs DDOG, MDB, etc."

When does this stabilize? What should we expect long-term?\"\n\n**Q3** [MEDIUM]\n> \"Datadog said 12% of their revenue is from AI workloads. What's that number for Snowflake?\"\n\n### Defense response it drafted\n\n**Talking Points:**\n- RPO is $6.9B, up 33% - that's future revenue locked in\n- Added 252 customers over $1M this year (now at 688 total)\n- Product revenue still growing 27%\n- Cortex AI is in 2,000+ accounts now\n\n**Response:**\n\"Yeah NRR came down from peak levels but that's customers optimizing how they use the platform, not churn. Look at the leading indicators - RPO up 33%, added 252 enterprise customers, Cortex adoption is ramping. We feel good about where we're headed.\""
